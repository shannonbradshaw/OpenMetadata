# Lineage

## Introduction

Data Lineage helps both data producers and consumers have a clear view on the flow of data. It can help us uncover critical assets,
assess the impact of any issue or outage and understand how changes propagate.

With OpenMetadata we can both capture this lineage information from services such as Airflow, as well as allow individual
users to share their knowledge via manual updating the lineage graph in the UI.
